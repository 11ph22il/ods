In this chapter, we study two representations of graphs and basic
algorithms on these representations.  Mathematically, a \emph{(directed)
graph} is a pair $G=(V,E)$ where $V$ is a set (called vertices) and $E$
is a set of ordered pairs of vertices called \emph{edges}.  For our
purposes, we will assume that $V=\{0,\ldots,#n#-1\}$.

The typical operations we would like to perform on graphs are:
\begin{itemize}
  \item #addEdge(i,j)#: Add the edge $(#i#,#j#)$ to $E$.
  \item #removeEdge(i,j)#: Remove the edge $(#i#,#j#)$ from $E$.
  \item #hasEdge(i,j)#: Check if the edge $(#i#,#j#)\in E$ 
  \item #outEdges(i)#: Return a #List# of all integers $#j#$ such that
  $(#i#,#j#)\in E$
  \item #inEdges(i)#: Return a #List# of all integers $#j#$ such that
  $(#j#,#i#)\in E$
\end{itemize}

Note that these operations are not terribly difficult to implement
efficiently.  For example, the first three operations can be implemented
directly by using a #USet#, so they can be implemented in constant
expected time using the hash tables discussed in \chapref{hashing}.
The last two operations can be implemented in
