Use GNU make to create the files ods-java.pdf and ods-cpp.pdf

During the make process, all of the tex files in this directory, except
ods.tex, are preprocessed with the perl scripts snarf(cpp|java).pl.
These scripts allows for the insertion of source code into the tex files.
This script does two things:

1. It expands \(code|java|cpp)import{} commands into Verbatim environments that
   contain highlighted versions of the relevant source code.

2. It treats anything sandwiched between # and # as inline source
   code that is also highlighted and typeset with a fixed-width font.
   This command is suitable for use inside of math environments so that
   source code variables and functions can be used inside of equations.

Any .tex file whose filename looks like blah-cpp.tex or blah-java.tex
was generated by these perl scripts.  Don't edit them by hand.
