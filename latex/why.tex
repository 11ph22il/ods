\chapter*{Why This Book?}

There are plenty of books that teach introductory data structures.
Some of them are very good.  Most of them cost money, and the vast
majority of computer science undergraduate students will shell-out at
least some cash on a data structures book.

There are a few free data structures books available online.  Some are
very good, but most of them are getting old.  The majority of these
books became free when the author and/or publisher decided to stop
updating them.  Updating these books is usually not possible, for two
reasons:  (1)~The copyright belongs to the author or publisher, who
may not allow it.  (2)~The \emph{source code} for these books is often
not available.  That is, the Word, WordPerfect, FrameMaker, or \LaTeX\
source for the book is not available, and the version of the software
that handles this source may not even be available.

The goal of this project is to forever free undergraduate computer
science students from having to pay for an introductory data structures
book.  I have decided to implement this goal by treating this book
like an Open Source software project.  The \LaTeX\ source, \lang\
source, and build scripts for the book are available for download
on the book's website (\url{opendatastructures.org}) and also,
more importantly, on a reliable source code management site
(\url{github.com/patmorin/ods}).

This source code is released under a Creative Commons Attribution license,
meaning that anyone is free to \emph{share}: to copy, distribute and
transmit the work; and to \emph{remix}: to adapt the work, including the
right to make commercial use of the work.  The only condition on these
rights is \emph{attribution}: you must acknowledge that the derived work
contains code and/or text from \url{opendatastructures.org}.

Anyone can contribute corrections/fixes using the \texttt{git} source-code
management system.  Anyone can fork from the current version of the
book and develop their own version (for example, in another programming
language).  They can then ask that their changes be merged back into
my version.  My hope is that, by doing things this way, this book will
continue to be a useful textbook long after my interest in the project
(or my pulse, whichever comes first) has waned.
