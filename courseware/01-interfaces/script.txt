Interfaces/Abstract Data Types

<click>

An interface describes what a data structure does does without specifying
how it does it.

<click>

The interface defines the operations that a data structure supports.

<click>

It also defines what those operations mean---the semantics.

<click>

An interface deliberately <i>does not</i> describe how the data
structure is represented or how it is implemented.

An interface answers the question: ``What does it do?'' and deliberately 
doesn't answer the question ``How does it do it?''

<click>

The idea of abstracting a data structure's operations away from it's
implementation was introduced in a 1974 paper by 2008 ACM Turing Award
Winner Barbara Liskov along with her coauthor Stephen N. Zilles. 

Liskov and Zilles called this an Abstract Data Type, but we'll stick
with the name Interface.

Of course, this is all rather vague right now.  Rather than try for a
more precise definition, we'll jump in and describe some of the abstract
data types studied in this course.

Self-test questions:

Think of an automobile. Which parts of the automobile are parts of the
driver's interface?  Which parts are not?  

Can you think of more than one implementation of the car interface?

%======================================================================= 

The List Interface

<click>

A List represents a sequence of $n$ elements

<click>

The elements are indexed by the position in the list start at zero and
going up to $n-1$.

<click>

The List interface supports five operations:

<click>

We can ask for the size of the list

<click>

We can get the value of the i'th element in a list

<click>

We can set the value of the i'th element in a list

<click>

We can add a new value at a specific position in the list

<click>

We can remove a value from the list
