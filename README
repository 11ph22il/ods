latex/ contains the latex sources
java/ods contains the java sources

To make the book (ods.pdf):
cd latex ; make
This will require a decent installation of pdflatex, perl, ipe, inkscape,
and pdftk.

To make the Java archive ods.jar:
cd java ; make

To make both:
make

How it works:

./java/test    - Test code from Sun/Oracle and Apache
./java/junk    - Small sample code snippets used in the text
./java/ods     - The Java data structures sources
./latex        - The book's latex source code and scripts
./latex/figs   - The book's ipe figures
./latex/images - Images used in the book

The Makefile and Perl script in ./latex do the following:
1. Convert figures in ./latex/figs into pdf
2. Convert images in ./latex/images into pdf
3. Scan the latex sources and generate -tmp.tex files that include source
   code from ./java directories
4. Run pdflatex and bibtex to generate the file ods.pdf
